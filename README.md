The online platform for Octave.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get the React front-end and Node.js/Express backend up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
You need `node` and `npm` installed globally on your machine.

### Running the Front-end
Go to the `frontend` folder, and run `npm i` to install all the requisite packages needed for the front-end setup.

### Running the Back-end
Go to the `backend` folder, and run `npm install` to install all the requisite packages needed for the back-end setup. Before you start the server, you need to create a `.env` file in the backend folder with the parameters `MONGO_URI = <The connection Link>`. After that, to start the server, run `npm start` to start the server and visit the website at localhost:8000

### Working Instructions
- Always pull from the main branch before creating your feature branch to start work.
- Don't push directly into the main branch.
- Create a merge request, you can't add anything to the main branch without approval from atleast one member of the team.
